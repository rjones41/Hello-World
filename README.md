# Hello-World
New to this spot
I am Rodney Jones. I wish that computers was out before I was born. I would have loved to do these things when I was a teenager. I am a retired Soldier from the Army. I am know into IT and trying to gather more knowledge to advance my skill set. I am from Chicago but I now live in Houston. I came here to work in the oil field, but people are to evil and cut throat. So now I changed my career to IT.
